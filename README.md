# A Machine Learning Approach for Network Intrusion Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on developing an advanced system to identify security threats in network traffic using machine learning techniques. As the number of internet-connected devices grows exponentially, including IoT appliances and mobile devices, the potential attack surface for malicious actors expands significantly. Traditional security measures often fall short in detecting novel attack patterns, necessitating more sophisticated solutions.

## Challenge
Modern networks face increasingly complex security challenges:
- Exponential growth of connected devices
- Emergence of new attack vectors
- Limitations of signature-based detection systems
- Need for real-time threat identification

## Solution Architecture
Our system employs a multi-layered approach combining:
1. **Data Processing Layer**: Handles network traffic capture and feature extraction
2. **Machine Learning Layer**: Implements advanced classification algorithms
3. **Deployment Layer**: Provides scalable API endpoints for integration

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components
- **Feature Extraction**: Utilizing 80+ network flow characteristics including:
  - Packet timing statistics
  - Protocol-specific metrics
  - Behavioral patterns
- **Classification Engine**: Gradient Boosted Decision Trees implementation
- **API Interface**: RESTful endpoints for real-time analysis

### Performance Characteristics
The system achieves high detection accuracy while maintaining:
- Low latency for real-time operation
- Efficient resource utilization
- Scalable architecture for enterprise deployment

## Deployment Options
The solution supports multiple deployment scenarios:

### Local Deployment
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate ml-ids
pip install -e .
mlflow models serve -m build/models/gradient_boost -p 5000
```

### Cloud Deployment (AWS)
```bash
# Build and push container
make sagemaker_build_image TAG=1.0
make sagemaker_push_image TAG=1.0

# Execute training
make sagemaker_train_aws \
  SAGEMAKER_IMAGE_NAME={ecr-image-name}:1.0 \
  JOB_ID=ml-ids-job-0001
```

## Integration
The system provides multiple integration points:
- REST API for batch processing
- WebSocket interface for real-time alerts
- Python client libraries for simplified access

Example API request:
```bash
curl -X POST \
  http://api-endpoint.example.com/predictions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"columns":["feature1","feature2",...],"data":[[value1,value2,...]]}'
```

## Benefits
- **Proactive Threat Detection**: Identifies novel attack patterns
- **Reduced False Positives**: Advanced ML algorithms minimize incorrect alerts
- **Scalable Architecture**: Cloud-native design supports growing networks
- **Continuous Learning**: Model updates improve detection over time

## Future Enhancements
